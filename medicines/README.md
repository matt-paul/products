This project contains the source code for the medicines products portal, which can be found at: https://products.mhra.gov.uk/

This site allows users to find:

- The leaflets which are provided with medicines
- The description of the medicinal productâ€™s properties and how it can be used
- Scientific reports about marketing authorisations for medicines

- [doc-index-updater](./doc-index-updater) - API to automate the management of documents on the site
- [import](./import) - importer that can be run locally to update documents on the site

## Releasing

To create a new release and deployment to production, create and push a new tag of the form `medicinesweb.v0.0.0` (e.g. `medicinesweb.v1.3.0`), incrementing as required from the most recent . The `medicines-web-release` workflow will then automate the creation of a new deployment in Github, build and test the tagged commit and then push the code to the production storage container. You can then update the release notes with any useful detail in Github.

Clearing the CDN is still a manual step, as it requires an elevated permission to the current production storage account. It's on the roadmap to migrate the production storage account to the same subscription as the rest of the infrastructure in this repository, after which clearing the CDN can be automated as part of the same release workflow.
